# README.md for DevOps CA1 Assignment

## Assignment Overview

This assignment focuses on Version Control with Git, utilizing a Tutorial React.js and Spring Data REST application. It aims to enhance understanding of DevOps practices, especially in version control and application deployment using Git.

## Operative Guidelines

- Use a **private repository** for your work.
- Work primarily through the **command line** for Git operations.
- **Create issues** in GitHub to track tasks and features.
- Organize files in a specified folder structure for clarity and efficiency.

## Goals/Requirements

### Week 1:

1. **Initialize the Repository**:
```bash
cd <local-repository-location> #changes the directory to the one that will be used to create the repository

git init #initializes a ".git" repository in the directory

touch README.md #creates a new file called README.md

git add README.md #adds the unstaged changes to the staging area, to be afterwards pushed to the distant repository

git commit -m "First Commit" # Commits the staged files with a message (-m)

git remote add <name> <url-of-remote-origin>  # adds a remote origin to push and pull from

git push -u origin master #commits pushed to the remote repository
#the "-u" note and the "master" are used to set manually (-u) the name of the desired branch (master) where to push

2. **Clone the Tutorial React.js and Spring Data REST Application.**
´´´bash

cd <local-repository-location> #as previously explained

git clone <url-of-the-tutorial> #clones the repository, not only provides a copy

2. **Initialize the Project**: Copy the application code into your repository.
3. **Version Control**: Commit your changes regularly. Use tags to mark version releases.
4. **New Feature**: Implement a new feature, such as adding a `jobYears` field to the application. Test thoroughly.

### Week 2:

1. **Branching**: Utilize branches for developing new features and fixing bugs. Adopt a consistent workflow and tagging strategy.
2. **Merge and Pull Requests**: Merge your branches into the main branch, ensuring no conflicts and maintaining code quality.

## Technical Report Requirements

Your README.md should document:
- **Analysis Design**: Outline the project design and analysis.
- **Implementation Steps**: Step-by-step guide on how you implemented the project.
- **Tutorial-Style Instructions**: Provide clear instructions for others to follow.
- **Justifications**: Explain the reasoning behind your choices throughout the project.
- **Alternative Version Control Analysis**: Analyze and implement an alternative version control solution, detailing its advantages and disadvantages compared to Git.

## Markdown Syntax

Use Markdown syntax to format your document, making it readable and well-structured. Include:

- Headings and subheadings
- Bullet points and numbered lists
- Code snippets (for commands and code examples)
- Links to resources or further readings

This README.md template aims to guide the documentation of your DevOps CA1 assignment, ensuring a comprehensive and understandable report.
