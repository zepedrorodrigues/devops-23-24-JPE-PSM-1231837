# README.md for DevOps CA1 Assignment

## Assignment Overview

This assignment focuses on Version Control with Git, utilizing a Tutorial React.js and Spring Data REST application. It aims to enhance understanding of DevOps practices, especially in version control and application deployment using Git.

## Operative Guidelines
- Use a **private repository** for your work.
- Work only through the **command line** for Git operations.
- **Create issues** in Bitbucket to track tasks and features.
- Organize files in a specified folder structure for clarity and efficiency.

## Goals/Requirements

### Week 1:
1. **Initialize the Repository**: Create a new repository and initialize it with a .gitignore and README.md file.
1. **Initialize the Project**: Copy the application code into your repository.
2. **Version Control**: Commit your changes regularly. Use tags to mark version releases.
3. **New Feature**: Implement a new feature, such as adding a `jobYears` field to the application. Test thoroughly.

### Week 2:

1. **Branching**: Utilize branches for developing new features and fixing bugs. Adopt a consistent workflow and tagging strategy.
2. **Merge and Pull Requests**: Merge your branches into the main branch, ensuring no conflicts and maintaining code quality.

## Technical Report Requirements

Your README.md should document:
- **Analysis Design**: Outline the project design and analysis.
- **Implementation Steps**: Step-by-step guide on how you implemented the project.
- **Tutorial-Style Instructions**: Provide clear instructions for others to follow.
- **Justifications**: Explain the reasoning behind your choices throughout the project.
- **Alternative Version Control Analysis**: Analyze and implement an alternative version control solution, detailing its advantages and disadvantages compared to Git.

## Markdown Syntax

Use Markdown syntax to format your document, making it readable and well-structured. Include:

- Headings and subheadings
- Bullet points and numbered lists
- Code snippets (for commands and code examples)
- Links to resources or further readings

This README.md template aims to guide the documentation of your DevOps CA1 assignment, ensuring a comprehensive and understandable report.
